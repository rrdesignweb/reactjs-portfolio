        Hi, my name is Rowan, a Frontend Developer from Melbourne, Australia. I am focussed on delivering
        great user and developer experiences harnessing the best UI practices such as mobile
        first design, semantic layouts, component driven development and accessibility. I use modern frontend
        workflow tools such as React JS, Webpack, NPM, SASS and GIT.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about choosing the best solution for the job at hand and
        learning about best frontend tools and techniques.
